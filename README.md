# PDF-based QA Bot with Langchain and OpenAI

This project demonstrates a PDF-based Question Answering (QA) bot built using Node.js, Express, Langchain, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model. The bot reads a PDF document, processes its content, and answers questions based on the document's content.
